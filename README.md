# RolePlayersGuild
The original codebase for the website "RolePlayersGuild" that existed from 2016 to 2017.

I put about 400+ hours of my personal development time into this website's code and have been unsure what to do with it all this time. I'm sharing it here in case it's helpful to anyone else. The site was built with WebForms using .NET 4.6; at the time, I felt most comfortable with WebForms. I tried moving the site over to MVC at one point, but the motivation was quickly lost, and I ended up just shutting the site down eventually due to the toxicity that my staff members were encountering despite this being a free website that I was paying out of my own pockets to keep up and running. Financially and mentally, keeping the site up made no sense anymore.

I don't have a copy of the DB Schema anymore, so you'll have to reverse-engineer it from the SQL queries in the code if you want to. Luckily, I was never fond of using TSQL, so all the queries are included in this code except for any Views. Also, I nuked the .sln file at some point, so you'll have to import this as a Project into another Solution.

As this is being released under the MIT license, as long as you abide by those rules, you should be fine to do what you want with this code, but I would appreciate it if you gave credit to myself (Villanite) or Avinadal LLC when using this code somewhere in your version.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them, but I make no guarantees that I can answer them anymore, as I last actively looked at this code in 2017.

Thanks, and have fun!
