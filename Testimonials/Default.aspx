    <h1>Testimonials</h1>
    <p>The Role-Players Guild, as we state in various places, is built for role-players by role-players. Because of this, your opinions and suggestions matter very much to us. So much, that when you give us so many kind words, we can't help it but to feel excited and want to show you off!</p>

            <blockquote>"I've been writing a long time, most of my life. With the best intent I say this, RPG was founded by people who are tired of elitst moderators who don't adhere to standards that apply to everyone. I, for one, am thrilled to finally have a site I can let the entirety of my creative pursuits flow. The dev team actively listens to concerns, updates us regularly on coming changes and features and interacts with us. We see those with power and they see us. This site is by roleplayers, for roleplayers, and I stand behind the vision Villanite has shown us."</blockquote>

        <div class="Testimonial clearfix">
            <blockquote>"To start off, I really like this site, I really do. I've been role-playing since MySpace, so that's 10+ years. Since then many sites have come and gone, and when I first got here I thought it was gonna be like one of those sites. It starts off really good, but before you know it, B.S. just has clogged it down to the point of, "Why bother?" The mods are very approachable and actually give a damn! The heck, every other site has just had mods that would hear problems and basically say, 'Oh by the way vote for us! Also, we're not gonna do anything!' They apologize when something bad happens to the site and don't abuse their power. The people here are just the bee's knees. I mentioned my Anxiety, and instantly, I got a crap-ton of people worrying about me, asking if I was okay! It warmed my heart, to say the least. Finally, what I like about the site is that both the role-players and the mods are never content with today, and are always looking to better the site and role-playing in general."</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"I am especially fond of this place. It does so well for me. And I feel others agree. I click all the little links on the website to find out new things. I even use the character search. What you have been able to do is like genius; the ability to approach and speak with anyone you like, without restraint or need for permissions. This is natural. I am so happy here."</blockquote>
