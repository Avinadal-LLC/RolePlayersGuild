    <h1>Character Art Commissions</h1>
    <p>The Role-Players Guild has realized that we have various talented artists among our members and we feel it would be unfair to not give them the credit they deserve. As such, we've put this page together to help out our members who do commission work so they can make a little extra money and our members can use artwork truly designed for their original characters.</p>
    <p>As time goes by, we will link to pages that include information about these artist, whether that be their own personal sites, or even their writer profiles here on RPG. Please understand that each artist will have their own price range, their own style and their own timelines for artwork. RPG should not, in any way, be held responsible for the actions of any of these artists listed. All of your interactions with these artist are between yourself and the artists and RPG will not play as any kind of mediator outside of this initial referral.</p>
    <h3>What You Need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Funds</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>These artists work hard to master their trade and perfect their art. It is only fair that payment be made to them in return for their services. Generally, commission work is paid for with half of the payment up front. Once a watermarked version is approved by the buyer, the other half is expected for the release of the artwork. This ensures that the artist is not simply wasting their time with a piece they won't get paid for and that the buyer isn't at risk. Some artists may even use escrow-type services for this kind of work. Fees may vary with that kind of option.

            <strong>Communication</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>RPG will work hard to vet the list of artists we link to, to make sure that they understand the importance of communication during a project. Please keep in mind, however, that communication is very much a two-way road. Artists may need to contact you from time to time to work out particular details or may need your opinion on something before moving forward. You must be available for the artists, or the project will only drag on and frustrate both of you. In the same token, be sure that when you do ask for a commission, you are detailed with your request. Remember, they're drawing something for you that YOU imagined; they cannot read your mind and need you to guide them through what you're picturing.

            <strong>Patience</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality art work takes time. Rushing an artist will only result in you getting artwork you're unhappy with. Be patient, be courteous, and be understanding. Don't become a client from hell. Most artists will notify you if your timeline is affected. Meanwhile, you must understand that these artists have lives outside of working on your commission and sometimes they just get busy. Please be patient, but if you must ask about progress, make sure you do it in a well-mannered fashion.
